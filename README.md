# Designed by me 
<hr>
These designs are super-random, and typically not related at all. 

Some might be UI's of android applications, others might be designs for specific use-cases, like a shopping cart. 

As soon as I've aggregated a decent amount of design work here, I'll start categorizing them, as best I can.

Starting off with these 2 categories should do it: 

1. Apps  

2. Websites (web-page concepts, or even entire websites)

Nothing here. You can do with these designs as you please.
